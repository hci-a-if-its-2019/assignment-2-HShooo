# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches
```
Be sure to label the different versions so you can differentiate them in your discussion. 
If you choose to take a picture of your sketches, please make sure the texts are readable.

### 2. Version Differences
```
First Solution i use tabs to difference the log in and the sign up.
The second one i used pop-ups.
```

### 3. Selected Sketch
```
I used the first one because it seems to be better
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
Please write a paragraph expressing what you have learned from the contextual inquiry, 
and how it is reflected in your design.
```

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
```
I using the Mobile to open this since the mobile phone in wattpad always troubeled.
```
### 2. Users
```
Please write down the assumptions about your users. 
What level of experience do you expect? 
Who familiar with computers/gadget will they be? 
What ages? 
Are there any other factors about the users that will influence your design?
```

## Part C: Prototypes
